# Problem Statement
Build a ML algorithm which can make predictions of future(60 minutes) blood glucose values, based on previously measured values(of blood glucose, heart rate and activity).

# Aim
Diabetic people get early warnings to mitigate the effects(strokes, heart attack etc) of diabetes. These early warning gives them motivation to exercise.

# Dataset
Distance Activity Data
Heart Rate Data
Blood Glucose Data

# Machine Learning Model Used : Random Forest
